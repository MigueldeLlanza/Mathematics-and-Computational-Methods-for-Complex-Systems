# Mathematics-and-Computational-Methods-for-Complex-Systems
Module of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems (University of Sussex)
## 1st Assignment: Optimization algorithms
Examine the convergence of two optimization algorithms (gradient ascent and hill-climbing) in simple anc complex landscapes. For each algorithm, it is analyzed the effects of selecting different hyperparameters in each scenario. 

## 2nd Assignment: Stability in complex systems 
Examine stability using euler integration
