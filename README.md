# Mathematics-and-Computational-Methods-for-Complex-Systems
Module of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems (University of Sussex).
## 1st Assignment: Optimization algorithms
Examine the convergence of two optimization algorithms (gradient ascent and hill-climbing) in simple and complex landscapes. For each algorithm, I explored the effects of selecting different hyperparameters in each scenario. 

## 2nd Assignment: Stability in complex systems 
Examine stability using euler integration.
